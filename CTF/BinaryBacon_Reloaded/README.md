## Setup Guide
1. upload with question text(it is the question)

## Solution 
1. the flag is hidden in the cipher text in groups of 6, ignoring all spaces and punctuations 
 ```110011 100001 011011 110001 010111 110010 001111 100011 011011 100010 111100 001111 100001 101011 001111 100000 001111 100010 011011 110010 001111 100000 001111 100010```
2. each group can be used to form braille eg,110011 would be equal to

   1 1
   
   1 1
   
   0 0
   
3. decode and solve 

### Flag
`GCTF{wh4t_ev3n_15_th15}`
