Good luck!

## Setup Guide
1. put file on server

## Distribution
file with code
- Spiral.txt


## Solution
1.	The file is basically a qrcode
2.	The qrcode is in the form of ascii characters and if you print it in the form of a spiral, or draw it out , the qrcode will be clearly seen
3.	you can then change the ascii characters to unicode for easier scanning
