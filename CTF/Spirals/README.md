# Spirals

## Question Text

I just read junji ito's uzumaki and i am very inspired, so i decided to implement a simple obfuscation function!
heres the link to the comic:

<a><img src="https://www.barcodesinc.com/generator/image.php?code=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzumaki&style=197&type=C128B&width=531&height=50&xres=1&font=3" alt="the barcode printer: free barcode generator" border="0"></a>

Good luck!

## Setup Guide
1. put file on server

## Distribution
file with code
- Spiral.txt


## Solution
1.	The file is basically a qrcode
2.	The qrcode is in the form of ascii characters and if you print it in the form of a spiral, or draw it out , the qrcode will be clearly seen
3.	you can then change the ascii characters to unicode for easier scanning
