# AutoEncryptSys
# Question Text

I retrieved a bunch of files from the an automatic encryption system online, I found out how they encrypt is by using aes followed by base64 encrypting it and storing it in a text file with the name being the key of the aes encryption. However, im only looking for one file that contains the flag... and i dont have time to look through all 1002 files could you please help me?

## Setup Guide
1. upload file on server

## Distribution
zip file containing all the files
- AES(found).zip

## Solution
1.	all the files are encrypted by AES followed by base64
2.	therefore, all you have to do is make a simple program to run through the entire directory and decrypt.
