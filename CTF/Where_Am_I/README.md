## Setup Guide
1. upload code to digisparks

## Solution
1.	when you plug in the digispark, it will open up a notepad and write out text
2.	in next few line you will get a line, presummably the cipher text ,`bp9SQPPssHVXgnOOkQ5k91jAfMgC0ur2jfPIwwZh8Cc`
3.  followed almost immediately by `SbCg==`
4.	after that you will realise that it is blinking...
5.  when decoding with morsecode, you get `weirdquestionrwd`
4.	next, for the cipher text add a `=` to it and you will be able to decode by key :)
