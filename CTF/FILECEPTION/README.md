Created by paux

## Setup Guide
1. upload file on server

## Distribution
jfif file with hidden zip file
- BESTESTMODEL.jfif

## Solution
1.	there is a zip file hidden in the image
2.	by opening the image using zip, you will realise that there is a file named "IMPORTNATDOCUMENTS"
3.	the zip file is encrypted, however, looking at the jfif in a text editor you will realise that at the last line, there is a line saying that the password is `long_pa55w0rd_y0u_c4nt_cr4ck`
