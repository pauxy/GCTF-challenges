# COOKIE AGENT

## Question Text

Please help me get into this site? 

Created by paux

## Setup Guide
1. Download tomcat
2. upload all 4 files into directory (NO SQL)

## Distribution
Distribute all the contents inside `distrib` folder to the users

## Solution
1.When trying to login, you will notice that the error page redirects to a page in the directory of "more"
2.upon checking the directory, you will realise that there is a page called "backup.txt". This contains the java code for the jsp page
3.the backup.txt file will also reveal that how passwords and username are read is through reading in 2 lines, the first line being username and second line being password
4.reading the backup.txt will reveal another file, check.txt, which contains a bunch of MD5 hashes
5.MD5 is a rather weak hash and players can use jack the ripper to crack them.
6.When you check the results, you will realise that two plaintexts are shown together :
```
username : root
password : roottoor
```
7.Upon login, you will get a sucessful login screen
